                The <em>Media Impact Monitor</em> will be a novel tool for protest
                groups and NGOs to measure and visualize their impact on public discourse.
                The tool will show how activist events affect the discourse across
                various media sources, such as local and national newspapers, social
                media, parliamentary debates, and more. Protest groups can use it
                to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate their actions and adapt
                them in a targeted manner to draw attention to their issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <em>Media Impact Monitor</em> project is hosted by <a
                  href="http://socialchangelab.org">Social Change Lab</a
                > and funded by <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/"

                  >BMBF</a
                >). The development of the prototype will take place from
                Marchâ€“August 2024.

              <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
              <p>
                NGOs and protest groups often want to draw more public attention
                to important issues in order to initiate social change. To do
                this, they organise panel discussions, publish articles on
                social media, send out press releases, organize demonstrations,
                practice civil disobedience, implement art actions, and so on.
                To evaluate their work, organizations often use &quot;press
                hits&quot; as a metric - but this is a poor substitute for the
                broader impact on agenda setting within public discourse, which
                the organizations are interested in but cannot easily analyze.
              </p>
              <p>
                This impact on agenda setting is difficult to capture
                statistically because of the complex causal relationship between
                discourse, action events, and external events. A correlational
                and even a simple regression analysis would therefore lead to
                statistically biased results.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is where we will start with the Media Impact Monitor: It
                aims to use innovative causal inference methods to quantify and
                visualize how action events affect agenda setting in public
                discourse.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Examples:</strong> The &quot;Last Generation&quot; can use
                it to see, for example, whether their actions distract from actual
                climate policy discussion or contribute to it constructively; and
                NGOs such as Greenpeace can evaluate which of their formats are most
                effective in media terms, and can use their media impact as an argument
                for donating to them.

                We are seeking activists and NGO employees to help us shape the
                tool: We are curious about your experience with media
                evaluation, your ideas and dreams, and your feedback on our
                prototypes!
